<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have always found myself looking for efficiencies and optimisations in my work. 
  Although my education was in aerospace engineering, in which I completed a masterâ€™s degree, 
  I discovered that my inclination for automation fit the digital space like a glove. 
  I transitioned to the data department upon completion of my graduate scheme and have not looked back. 
  As a newly minted member of the data team, I learned how to use PostgreSQL, 
  an activity I enjoyed so much that I decided to dedicate my free time to learning other common languages such Python,
   HTML, and JavaScript. I am hoping to continue developing these skills in a professional setting, using them to produce useful,
    user-friendly, and robust resources.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I play a lot of games. Mostly videogames (rpgs, for anyone interested), 
  but I also run a DnD campaign for myself and my university friends - which has a knack for descending into chaos, 
  and I am a semi-competitive badminton player. 
  Other hobbies include reading (high fantasy), skiing (when I can afford it), and playing the piano (once I get my keyboard fixed). 
  There are a smattering of others that I can only explain by calling myself a glutton for punishment (e.g. I can touch type. I am fast. 
  But I decided that I could be faster through the *simple* process of rewiring my brain to type a Dvorak keyboard...)
</p>

<p>P.S. Don't be fooled by my tone-over-text. In real life I have a shockingly low social battery (which is not the same as 'anti-social', 
  thank you very much) and am nowhere near as quick witted.</p>
